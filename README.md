# Recurrent Independent Mechanism
An implementation of [Recurrent Independent Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10893) (Goyal et al. 2019) in PyTorch.


It features adding and copying synthetic task from the paper.


# Examples
`./experiment_copying.sh 600 6 4 50 200` for full training & test run of RIMs on the copying task.

`./experiment_adding.sh 600 6 4 50 200 0.2` for full training and test run of RIMs on the adding task.
