This is a PyTorch implementation of
* RIMs 
* Adapted from [pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail)


The hyper-parameters used here are slightly different from the ones, in the paper. I've ran for 2 games
with the new set of hyper-parameters and attached the logs (See the logs folder), and the results are 
similar (or somewhat better) as compared to what have been mentioned in the paper.
